My First IT Job at Geek Squad

After the pandemic, I knew it was time to take the next step toward my career in IT. I had already earned my  A+ and was deep into studying networking fundamentals. I had spent so much time preparing, but getting that first IT job felt like a huge challenge. I remember reading stories online from people who started their careers at Geek Squad, and it seemed like a natural entry point into the field. So, I decided to apply at the Best Buy near my house.  

I still remember how excited I was when I got the call that I had passed the interview and would be starting in just a few days. I was only hired part-time initially, but I didn’t care, I was finally working in IT. After a few months, a full-time position opened up, and my manager offered me the spot. 

Even though I only worked at Geek Squad for about seven months (the pay wasn’t enough to sustain me long-term), I was genuinely happy to be there every single day. I was eager to learn, help customers, and gain as much experience as I could. I noticed that many of my colleagues had been there for years, and some of them seemed a bit tired of the daily work. But for me, everything was fresh and exciting. I was proactive about helping clients, answering their questions, and making sure they left feeling satisfied. That enthusiasm paid off. I started getting great customer satisfaction reviews, and to my surprise, I even won an award for Best Customer Service. Clients began asking for me by name when they returned to pick up their devices or needed assistance. I’ll never forget how a few of them brought me chocolates, gift cards, and small gifts. One client even gave me a heartfelt card on my last day, which I still have to this day.

Working at Geek Squad taught me so much, not just about technical troubleshooting but also about communication, patience, and empathy. I helped a lot of elderly clients, given the demographic of my neighborhood, and I quickly realized how challenging technology can be for them. Instead of rushing through fixes, I took the time to educate them, explain things clearly, and make sure they felt comfortable before they left. They truly appreciated that.
